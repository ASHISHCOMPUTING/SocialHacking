Appropriating Interaction Technologies
======================================

NYU ITP Fall 2013

###Course description

This course explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and representation as mediated by technology. We will investigate ways that technology can be used to augment, subvert, alter, mediate, and ultimately deepen interaction in a lasting way.

How do the things we build and use limit and expand the way we understand and relate to each other? We'll explore this question by building new tools and creating new situations for breaking us out of existing patterns, and discussing contextual examples from media art, performance art, psychology and pop culture. Technologies explored will include computer vision (face/body/eye tracking with openFrameworks), data representation and glitch, browser extensions and plugins (in Chrome), computer security, mobile platforms, and social automation and APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Mechanical Turk).

Students will develop projects that alter or disrupt social space in an attempt to reveal existing patterns or truths about our experiences and technologies, and possibilities for richer interactions. Different
tactics for intervention and performance will be explored, first through a set of short prompts or experiments, and then through a larger, more thorough intervention.

###Technical requirements

A conviction that creative people can derail society for the best, a deep love for code, and a willingness to explore uncomfortable situations. You should at least have taken Introduction to Computational Media or have similar experience with programming.

This four-point course will meet in the first twelve weeks of the semester.

###Syllabus

####Week 1: data representation and glitch
* what spaces are social? what are rules? how do we test them? what happens when we donâ€™t follow them? how do we misinterpret each other? failures, communication breakdowns and arguments, ambiguity?


####Weeks 2-3: social automation and APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Mechanical Turk)
* http://blog.blprnt.com/blog/blprnt/art-and-the-api
* how do we share things with each other? how do we influence each other? how do we control each other? how do we push back? how do others help you understand/shape/change who you are?
* social psychology influence experiments
* tactical media for protest
* language analysis (LIWC, LSM, sentiment)

####Weeks 4-5: browser extensions and plugins (in Chrome)
* who are you? how do you communicate/represent this? identity shaped by context
* http://artzilla.org/

####Weeks 6-7: computer security
* what does it mean to be hacked? can you hack yourself? 
* social engineering, phishing, cross-site scripting, trolling, authenticity

####Weeks 8-9: computer vision (face/body/eye tracking with openFrameworks)
* surveillance, privacy, warfare, video chat and mediated video-based interaction

####Weeks 10-12: mobile platforms
* how do we find each other? how do we connect? how do we initially engage? 
* how do we interact with each other in public social spaces? what are the patterns and rules and expectations? communication, conversation
* location awareness, social networking

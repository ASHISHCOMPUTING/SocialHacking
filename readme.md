###Course description

This course explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and self representation as mediated by technology. We will investigate ways that technology can be used to augment, subvert, alter, mediate, and ultimately deepen interaction in a lasting way.

How do the things we build and use limit and expand the way we understand and relate to each other? We'll explore this question by building new tools and creating new situations for breaking us out of existing patterns, and discussing contextual examples from media art, performance art, psychology and pop culture. Technologies explored will include computer vision (face/body/eye tracking with openFrameworks), data representation and glitch, browser extensions and plugins (in Chrome), computer security, mobile platforms, and social automation and APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Mechanical Turk).

Students will develop projects that alter or disrupt social space in an attempt to reveal existing patterns or truths about our experiences and technologies, and possibilities for richer interactions. Different
tactics for intervention and performance will be explored, first through a set of short prompts or experiments, and then through a larger, more thorough intervention.

###Technical requirements

A conviction that creative people can derail society for the best, a deep love for code, and a willingness to explore uncomfortable situations. You should at least have taken Introduction to Computational Media or have similar experience with programming.

This four-point course will meet in the first twelve weeks of the semester.

###Syllabus

####Week 1 (9/9): Data representation and glitch
* Class overview
    * Policy regarding auditing: if you come you should be engaged, but we can’t create a situation where we are giving you time instead of students who are registered.
    * Policy regarding attendance: you can miss one class, anything else you fail.
    * Policy regarding work: we are going to be introducing a variety of techniques and tools, ranging in technical difficulty. our main requirement for work is that it is of high quality -- it need not be hypertechnical, but it does need to be very well thought out and well executed.
* Attendance and contracts.

* What spaces are social? What are rules? How do we test them? What happens when we don’t follow them? How do we misinterpret each other? Failures, communication breakdowns and arguments, ambiguity?
* Breaching experiments, sociology, Garfinkel, Goffman, and Milgram

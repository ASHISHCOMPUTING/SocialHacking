## Course description

This course explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and self representation as mediated by technology. We will investigate ways that technology can be used to augment, subvert, alter, mediate, and ultimately deepen interaction in a lasting way.

How do the things we build and use limit and expand the way we understand and relate to each other? We'll explore this question by building new tools and creating new situations for breaking us out of existing patterns, and discussing contextual examples from media art, performance art, psychology and pop culture. Technologies explored will include computer vision (face/body/eye tracking with openFrameworks), data representation and glitch, browser extensions and plugins (in Chrome), computer security, mobile platforms, and social automation and APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Mechanical Turk).

Students will develop projects that alter or disrupt social space in an attempt to reveal existing patterns or truths about our experiences and technologies, and possibilities for richer interactions. Different
tactics for intervention and performance will be explored, first through a set of short prompts or experiments, and then through a larger, more thorough intervention.

## Technical requirements

A conviction that creative people can derail society for the best, a deep love for code, and a willingness to explore uncomfortable situations. You should at least have taken Introduction to Computational Media or have similar experience with programming.

This four-point course will meet in the first twelve weeks of the semester.

## Syllabus

### Week 1 (9/9): Data representation and glitch
* Class overview
    * Policy regarding auditing: if you come you should be engaged, but we can’t create a situation where we are giving you time instead of students who are registered.
    * Policy regarding attendance: you can miss one class, anything else you fail.
    * Policy regarding work: we are going to be introducing a variety of techniques and tools, ranging in technical difficulty. our main requirement for work is that it is of high quality -- it need not be hypertechnical, but it does need to be very well thought out and well executed.
* Attendance and contracts.

* What spaces are social? What are rules? How do we test them? What happens when we don’t follow them? How do we misinterpret each other? Failures, communication breakdowns and arguments, ambiguity?
* Breaching experiments, sociology, Garfinkel, Goffman, and Milgram

    * Create an HPI (human programming interface) that allows others to control some aspect of your life. By __next week (9/23)__ you should have the system built and in place and ready for a one week trial / performance / experiment.
    * Creatively misuse an existing API in order to reveal something about the service.

### Week 4 (9/30): extensions and customization
* Review HPI and misused API work
* Break
* Discussion: extension and customization
	* Extensions change your experience transparently, instead of drawing our attention to the object itself. While an API is something that exposes specific ways of interacting with a system, shielding the system from direct manipulation, an extension is generally something that is integrated directly with a system.
	* Remember the Goffman reading. How do these things fit together?
* Examples
	* Making an invisible layer on top of normal social space, you have to know the code or have the extension to see it.

### Week 7 (10/28): security, surveillance and privacy

Overview of projects and readings from last week.

### Weeks 8-9 (11/4, 11/11): computer vision (face/body/eye tracking with openFrameworks)

* Quick travel report.
* 3 groups presenting the remaining readings from last week.
* Two late assignments to share.
* Discuss midpoint feedback.
* Computer vision overview. We'll be working mainly from a public document called [Computer Vision in Interactive Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yky5TpKrxNDQzD7sXQ8gGpYFTsQhac1PrjYLQ3X_zJQ/edit?usp=sharing) which is part of a workshop. But there are a few links contained there that are also important references:

* __Reading__: Read all of [Computer Vision for Artists and Designers](http://www.flong.com/texts/essays/essay_cvad/) by Golan Levin and tweet one thought about something in the essay. For a really great more academic introduction to computer vision that doesn't relate to art, see [3D Computer Vision: Past, Present and Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyIzMr917Rc) a presentation by Steve Seitz at Google.
* __Assignment__: First we'll assign partners. In that group we ask you to create a filter or adapter using computer vision that improves your interaction with each other. A filter is something that only allows certain things through. An adapter is something that changes things that pass through it. For example, if you only wanted to video chat with people with dark skin, a filter would reject any invitations from people with light skin. An adapter would take all the light skinned people and make them darker skinned.

* Assignment
	* We will give one-day assignments for seven days (November 18 to November 24) that involve reflecting on the way you use your phone. We will share and discuss our experiences in class on November 25.
		* Day 1 - Delete all contacts you do not plan on contacting again.
		* Day 2 - Put your phone in "do not disturb" mode (that is, silence all rings, buzzes, notifications, etc).
		* Day 3 - Download an app you've been avoiding and overuse it all day.
		* Day 4 - Use your phone in "voice-only" mode (i.e., pretend it's a dumb phone).
		* Day 5 - Count how many times you check your phone.
		* Day 6 - Don't use your phone.
		* Day 7 - Trade your phone with someone else.
	* Pick one of the following and document your work before the last class, to be shared in the last class:
		* Create an app that fills a void that otherwise fills a void that you would otherwise imagine a person filling.
		* Imagine the most difficult social interaction you've ever had, and create an app that would have made it easier.
		* Create an app that has an effect on others that aren't using the app.
		* Create an app that causes or enables people to meet for a specific purpose.
